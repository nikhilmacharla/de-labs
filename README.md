## Techstack

### Workflow Orchestration

1. Airflow - An open-source tool for building data pipelines and manage workflows
1. Cloud Composer - A managed Airflow service on Google cloud
1. MWAA - A managed Airflow service on AWS cloud

## Training style

1. No docker-based setups: We will not be using Docker to setup tools initially because I believe it is a bad practice to use dockers during learning phase. We should setup things from scratch and then use dockers to automate the processes.
